Overview:

    The Alpheios Reading Tools can be used with any text or with
    texts that have been enhanced with aligned translations and
    sentence diagrams.
    They can also be used in two different modes: one for simply reading a 
    text and one for turning the text into the basis for a language quiz.

    Since the Alpheios Reading Tools can be used with texts that have different 
    resources associated with them they will attempt to detect 
    which resources are available and adjust the interface accordingly. 

   (It will also attempt to detect the language of the text it is displaying 
    so that it can consult the appropriate dictionaries, grammars etc.)

     When no special resources are associated with the current text,

         the only tool bar visible is a small one at the top of the screen
         with the Alpheios icon on the left.

           the Alpheios icon brings up a menu for

               -  Options, such as whether the selection of a word should
                        be by double click or mouseover, the sequence in which
                        dictionaries or grammars should be consulted, etc
               -  About, providing the current release number
               -  a Send Feedback button  and a link to the
               -  Alpheios site

            This small toolbar also has icons that take you directly 
            into independent reference resources such as Inflection tables 
            and Grammars- ones that have no specific relationship to the 
            current text.

         Furthermore when no text-specific resources are available,
         selecting a word brings up a new box with only
         two icons, one that provides a more complete definition, and
         one that takes you into the inflection table where that 
         specific inflection appears.  

     When some text-specific resources are available, as is
          currently only possible on our own website, a second, much larger
          toolbar appears below the Firefox toolbar at the top of the screen.
          It draws attention to the fact that you are accessing enhanced
          texts on our site and adds some new icons that are needed to
          use the additional resources.

     When the Alpheios reading tool detects that a translation is available, 

         a translation icon appears on this toolbar that permits the user 
         to open and close the translation pane.

     When the Alpheios reading tool detects that a sentence diagram
          is available, 

          selecting a word will bring up a box that includes a "Diagram" 
          icon that can be used to display the sentence diagram.

  In addition to working with two different kinds of texts, texts that
  have been enhanced by the association of resources with them
  such as translations or sentence diagrams, and texts that have not,
  the Alpheios reading tools can also be used in two different modes:  
  Reading Mode and Quiz Mode.

     In Reading Mode, as we have seen, selecting a word brings up
     a box that provides information about the word.
     while in Quiz Mode selected a word brings up a series of questions
     about that word. 

     You can switch back and forth between the modes by clicking on the 
     relevant icons at the upper left of the screen. The Quiz mode icon is 
     a lightbulb. The Reading mode icon shows an open book. 

     At present, Quiz mode is only available with Alpheios texts that have 
     translations and sentence diagrams associated with them.

     Customization to the individual user-

     You will readily see that we still have a good deal of work to do
     to make bring even the current functionality up to the level of
     a beta release, but we hope that the next release will include
     the ability to further customize the application to the needs
     and interests of individual users, so that the user can specify
     what and how he wants to learn and the program can keep track of how
     well he is doing.
   
     Tools for user participation-

     Quite legitimate differences of opinion may arise about the
     the definitions, the interpretation of inflections, the sentence 
     diagrams and alignment of the translations with the original text,
     and in future releases we hope to provide opportunities for users to
     suggest alternatives and discuss them among themselves.


     This is only an alpha release, with many features still incompletely
     or, what is worse, imperfectly implemented. But we hope it gives you
     enough of an impression of the intended functionality to enable you
     to comment and help direct our next steps. Thank you for your
     interest in the Alpheios Project.
     



How do I

 o  Install the Alpheios Greek and Latin reading tools?

     [should we just put a link here to your page instead of the following
      text?]

   For a first time installation-

        go to our web site    http://alpheios.net

        click on the yellow buttons to install our three tools in turn, 
        starting with the basic reader
        (note that Firefox may block installation until you allow it by
         clicking on the warning message near the top of the screen)

         You may download all three at once, but you will have to restart                Firefox before the are functional.

   If you already have a version of the Alpheios tools installed (or
   had to abort your initial installation for any reason) so that the
   yellow download buttons have disappeared, you can download the tools
   from:

      http://alpheios.net/content/installation.

   Firefox should alert you to the availability of new versions automatically
   unless you have explicitly turned off such notifications.

 o  Find texts that the tools will work with?

         In the future you will be able to use the tools with any web site
         in which the text is displayed in correct HTML and the appropriate
         Unicode encoding, even text you have created yourself. For this
         alpha release we should like you to use the tools only on our
         own site (where we have some specially prepared text that illustrates
         advanced functionality (such as aligned translations and sentence
         diagrams), and a very few other web sites where we have tested 
         the tools ourselves.
   
         All the texts that are usable with this alpha release are
         available from the alpheios.net site.

 o  Find the meaning of a Greek or Latin word?

         If you double click on any Greek or Latin word, a new box with a short
         definition in bold type should appear next to the word,  along with
         some other grammatical information.

         If you want a more complete definition, you can click on
         the little icon within the short definition box that is labelled 
         "Define". That will open another box with a much longer definition.

         If, instead of a definition, the box that comes up when you double
         click on a word simply asks you to define it yourself, you must
         somehow have gotten out of Reading mode and into Quiz mode. 
         Just click on the Reading Mode icon represented by an open book in the
         Alpheios toolbar near the top of the screen to return to
         Reading mode. 

         If you happen to be reading an Alpheios-enhanced text for which 
         an aligned translation is available, you can also see what the 
         translator considered an equivalent English expression: if you 
         move your cursor over the Greek or Latin text, the corresponding 
         English words in the translation panel should light up in yellow.
         (You can do the same from the English side)  But remember
         that this "contextual meaning" reflects the translator's interpretation         of what the Greek or Latin means in this particular context,
         and that this may differ significantly from the more general or 
         typical meanings that a dictionary provides.

         In the Options tab you can see which dictionaries are available
         and alter the sequence in which they are consulted if no 
         suitable entry is found in the first. (When you are not reading
         Alpheios-enhanced text, Options appears in the menu that opens 
         when you click on the Alpheios icon at the top of the screen 
         in the Firefox toolbar. When you are reading Alpheios-enhanced
         text, it also appears directly on the additional Alpheios toolbar) 

         In the Options tab you can also change the way that a word is
         selected when in Reading Mode, from double-clicking to just 
         mousing over it. Experiment to determine which option you find 
         most useful. (In Quiz Mode you only have the double-click option)

         Next: In the future we hope to add several more dictionaries, 
         including specialized ones, and make our use of our current
         dictionaries significantly more reliable.   

 o  Find what the inflection of a Greek or Latin word indicates about its
         grammar-

         double-clicking on a word will bring up not only a short definition
         but also an explanation of what the inflection of the word indicates
         about its grammar. (In the future we expect to allow the user to 
         choose from the options menu whether he wants to see both the
         meaning of the word and the meaning of the inflection at the same
         time, or just one or the other.)

         If you want to see a definition of the grammatical terms used in
         the description of the inflection, you can click on them
         to see their definition in a standard grammar.

         If you want to see the other possible inflections of the word,
         or compare its inflection to that of other words, you can
         click on the small "Inflect" icon in the popup box. This will take you
         to an inflection table that by default shows only the more
         common inflections and the type that your selected word
         represents, but which can be expanded to include all possible 
         inflections of all words. 

         Alternatively, for beginning students, a display can be chosen that
         shows only the most common forms together with the type represented
         by the selected word.
         
         The inflection tables are somewhat different in Greek and Latin,
         reflecting differences between the languages, especially the 
         greater number of variations in Greek. One feature currently only
         available for Latin, is the ability to permute the 
         sequence of voice, mood, conjugation when displaying verb
         inflections.

         We hope that our tools can help students to see the inflections
         of Greek and Latin as invaluable clues for the appreciation of
         these amazing languages rather than as problems or hurdles.
   
 o  Find out how a Greek or Latin word relates to the other words in the
         sentence. 

         Currently this option only available when a sentence diagram
         has been prepared for the text manually.

         If a diagram is available, the box that comes up when you 
         double-click to select a word will now contain a special 
         "Diagram" icon. Clicking on this icon will display the sentence 
         at the top of the screen with a tree diagram of all the word 
         dependencies below it. 

         The selected word will be highlighted in yellow, with the word on 
         which it is immediately dependent in light red, and any words that 
         depend on it in light green. These colors are redundant in the 
         diagram itself, but can be very helpful in the display of the 
         sentence at the top of the screen, where dependent words may not
         be contiguous.  

         Mousing over words in the sentence at the top of the screen will
         move the highlighting in the diagram as well.

         Moving the cursor away from nodes in the diagram
         will allow one to see a color scheme based on the word's
         part of speech rather than its dependency relations. See the
         guide to the color scheme at the bottom of the panel (It may
         be necessary to scroll down with larger sentences).

         Mousing over an arc rather than a node will also identify the
         nodes at either end of the arc.

         If you double-click on a word in the diagram, 
         you will get the same informative popup box that appears when
         reading the original text.

         Next:  We hope to provide tools for creating and editing your
         own tree diagrams.

         For more information about the definition of the relationships
         and the guidelines for defining dependency relationships see
         http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/syntax/treebank.
           

 o  Use Quiz mode?

         This mode is currently only available with the specially prepared
         texts that have an aligned translation and sentence diagrams
         associated with them.   
         The availability of Quiz mode is indicated by the light bulb icon 
         in the large Alpheios toolbar near the top of the screen.
         Click on the light bulb to enter Quiz Mode.

         Once you are in Quiz Mode, clicking on any word will start
         a quiz about that word.

         If the translation panel is open, you will be asked to click
         on all the English words that you think the translator used
         to translate the Greek.

         When you have chosen all the English words that match correctly,
         a new dialog box will appear that asks you to choose the 
         correct part of speech. After you make the correct choice,
         if the word is an inflected one such as a noun, verb or adjective,
         you are asked whether you would like to answer questions about the
         word's inflection. If you say yes, you are shown a grid of
         grammatical options where you can choose the correct option either
         directly, by clicking on a cell in the grid, or sequentially, 
         by clicking on the radio buttons on the left one after the other. 
         If you guess a wrong form, you are shown not only an error message 
         but a display of what that form would be.
         If you choose the sequential option, you may select the radio
         buttons in any order.
         (Verb forms are so numerous that the quiz is currently condensed 
         by omitting the sequential option)

         You can then either close the panel and return to the text, or
         further explore the word's meaning, inflection, and use in the 
         sentence with the icons for diagrams, definitions and inflections.

         If, on the other hand, the translation panel is not open, when
         you double click on a word you are asked to choose the correct
         meaning from a list as well as the correct part of speech. The
         questions then continue as they did when you started with the
         open translation panel.

         We hope to add a number of other quiz options in the near future.
